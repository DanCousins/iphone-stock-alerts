use this url in the script

create a telegram bot and it'll text you the postcode of the store that has stock, this may not be your nearest store

save the phone you want in your bag, and be ready to check out, this will save you time

when you get the notification, select pick up from store in your bag, and enter the postcode of the store the bot has texted you

i've made it easy so you can copy and paste from telegram
